# Arithmetic Game
## Description
This is a simple arithmetic game, built with [React](https://react.dev/). It is meant to be a
fun little project to continue exploring React, and also to be useful as a
learning tool for children anyone in need of improving their mental calculation
skills in basic arithmetic (i.e. me).
